            <h1>Alphascape NSSS World Downloads</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Alphascape</strong> (Formerly AlphaNSSS) is a Minecraft server running the Not So Seecret Saturday mod (NSSS), started on the 13th March 2023, and for over 2 years has been a
                place with a small friendly community and an amazing selection of player creations and builds on the server!
            </p>

            <p>
                Recently, Alphascape has undergone some more transformative changes, having migrated to Better Than Adventure (BTA) on the 5th June 2025. This migration was due to a number of factors,
                including the lack of new updates to NSSS, as well as dwindling player activity. So far the migration has been a great success, and the server is alive once more. A unique aspect to
                our migration is that we have kept all of the original world that was created in NSSS, so if you join the server today you will see the whole history over the past 2 years but with a
                fresh look now in BTA!

            <p>To remember the period of NSSS, you can find the world download below:</p>

                    Sometimes loading these worlds in singleplayer does not work. If that is the case, please run the server jar (found <a href="/Files/a1.1.11_111-1_server.jar">here</a>), and replace
                    the generated world file with one of the files below:
